Since 2021, the price of gas has skyrocketed. A group of upset taxi drivers rallied at a New York City gas station to demand rate surcharges. 

On top of that, Yellow taxis had to face the fierce competition from ride-hailing company such as Uber, while its meter rate have not changed since 2012.

The goal of this dashboard is to give insights to yellow taxi drivers to be able to face the competition from ride-hailing drivers, who have access to data in real time to maximize profit.




The data used in these code was collected from the website of The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). It is the agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxis and For-Hire vehicules, including : 



- Yellow taxi. They have the right to pick up street-hailing passengers anywhere in New York City. By law, there are 13,587 taxis in New York City.

- Green taxi. They are For-Hire Vehicles that are permitted to accept street-hails (in addition to e-hailing). In exchange, they can not hail in Manhattan (except Harlem) or the airports. This travel option was introduced in 2013 to better serve areas outside of central Manhattan.
